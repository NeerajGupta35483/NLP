    "\n",
    "Corpora: Corpora refer to a collection of written or spoken texts,\n",
    "usually in electronic format, that is used as a source of linguistic\n",

    "\n",
    "Tokens: Tokens are the basic units of text that are used for NLP tasks.\n",
    "A token can be a word, a punctuation mark, a number, or any other\n",

    "\n",
    "Unigrams, Bigrams, Trigrams: Unigrams, bigrams, and trigrams are types\n",
    "of n-grams used in NLP. Unigrams are single words, bigrams are two\n",

    "\n",
    "To generate n-grams from text, we can use a simple sliding window\n",
    "approach where we slide a window of size n over the text and generate\n",
    "n-grams at each position. For example, to generate bigrams, we slide a\n",
    "window of size 2 over the text and generate all adjacent pairs of words.\n",

    "**6. Explain Stemming**\n",
    "\n",
    "Stemming: It is the process of reducing a word to its stem or root form\n",
    "by removing the suffixes or prefixes. For example, the stem of the word\n",
    "\"running\" is \"run\". It is a simpler and faster technique than\n",
    "lemmatization but may not always produce accurate results.\n",

    "Part-of-speech (POS) tagging: It is the process of assigning grammatical\n",

    "Chunking or shallow parsing: It is the process of identifying and\n",
    "grouping together the syntactically related words in a sentence, such as\n",
    "noun phrases, verb phrases, and prepositional phrases. It is called\n",
    "shallow parsing because it only involves identifying the immediate\n",
